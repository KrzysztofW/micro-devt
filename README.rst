Overview
========

Microdevt is a microcontroller development toolkit for quickly developing
embedded applications.
The toolkit provides asynchronous timers, a task scheduler and a zero-copy,
event-based TCP/IP stack. The asynchronous approach of developing Microdevt
applications allows to benefit as much as possible of the precious and very
limited resources of microcontrollers.
It is distributed freely under the GPL-2 open source license and is designed
for reliability and ease of use.
